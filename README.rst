Ahem
====

Ahem is a notifications framework for Django projects, it uses
declarative style just like Django models.

Instalation
===========

::

    pip install Ahem

Add it to the list of installed apps in your settings file:

.. code:: python

    # settings.py

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        'ahem',
    )

If you are using ``Celery``, configure the celery beat schedule variable
so periodic tasks can run:

.. code:: python

    # settings.py

    from ahem.loader import get_celery_beat_schedule
    CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE = get_celery_beat_schedule()

    # you may add more periodic tasks after this:
    CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE.update({
        'other-task': {
            'task': 'mytasks.the_taks',
            'schedule': crontab(...),
        }
    })

Documentation
=============

| Ahem can be runned both with or without
`celery <http://celery.readthedocs.org/>`__. If the celery lib can be
imported, it will try sending notifications asynchronously, else it will
send then in the same thread it was called.
| Periodic notifications will not work without celery.

| **Attention**
| Sending notifications without celery may slow down your system, please
be careful.

Notifications
-------------

To define notifications, create a ``notifications.py`` file in any of
the installed apps of your project and create a class that extends ahem
``Notification`` class.

.. code:: python

    # my_django_app/notifications.py

    from datetime import timedelta
    from ahem.notification import Notification
    from ahem.scopes import QuerySetScope
    from ahem.triggers import DelayedTrigger

    class MyProjectNotification(Notification):
        name = 'my_project'

        scope = QuerySetScope()
        trigger = DelayedTrigger(timedelta(days=1))

        backends = ['email']
        templates = {
            'default': 'path/to/template.html'}

-  ``name`` will be used as the id of your notification, it should be
   unique in your project.
-  ``scope`` defines which users will receive the notification.
-  ``trigger`` defines how and when the notification will be triggered.
-  ``backends`` is a list of available backend names for the
   notification.
-  ``templates`` dictionary with templates to be used for each backend.

Context
-------

get\_context\_data(self, user, backend\_name, \*\*kwargs):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can override ``get_context_data`` to add more variables to the
context. ``User`` is added to context by default, remember to call
``super`` if overriding.

.. code:: python

    class TheNotification(Notification):
        ...
        def get_context_data(self, user, backend_name, **kwargs):
            kwargs = super(TheNotification, self).get_context_data(
                user, backend_name, **kwargs)
            kwargs['extra_context'] = 'This will be shown in the notification'
            return kwargs

Backends
--------

Currently, ``EmailBackend`` is the only backend available. Developers
are encouraged to build new ones and merge then to this repository via
Pull Request.

Registering users in a backend
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before sending a notification to a user using a specific backend, you
need to register it.

.. code:: python

    from ahem.utils import register_user

    register_user('backend_name', user,
        setting1='username', setting2='secure_key')

EmailBackend
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  name: ``email``
-  settings: no settings required. The ``User`` email will be used.

Context data
''''''''''''

-  ``subject`` will be used as the email subject.
-  ``from_email`` the email the message will be sent from, default is
   DEFAULT\_FROM\_EMAIL.
-  ``use_html`` if true, the email will be sent with html content type.

Scheduling a notification
-------------------------

Use the ``schedule`` method to trigger a notification. Use the
``context`` kwarg to pass a context dictionary to the notification.

.. code:: python

    # this will trigger the notification according to it's `trigger`
    # for the MyProjectNotification, it will wait 1 day before sending
    # the notification.
    MyProjectNotification.schedule(context={'some_param': 'value'})

Overriding backends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also limit the backends that will be used by passing a list to
the ``backends`` kwarg.

**Since the EmailBackend is currently the only one available, this
feature is currently useless**

.. code:: python

    MyProjectNotification.schedule(backends=['email'])

Overriding trigger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also explicitly tell when the notification should be sent by
passing ``delay_timedelta`` or ``eta``.

.. code:: python

    # Notification will be sent at 23:45
    from celery.schedules import crontab
    MyProjectNotification.schedule(eta=crontab(crontab(hour=23, minute=45)))

    # Notification will be send 20 minutes after it was scheduled
    from datetime import timedelta
    MyProjectNotification.schedule(delay_timedelta=timedelta(minutes=20))

Scopes
------

Scopes are a declarative way to select which users will receive the
notification when it's executed. Ahem comes with 2 scopes by default,
but if you are feeling adventurous you can build your onw one.

QuerySetScope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``QuerySetScope`` will return all users if no argument is passed but you
can pass a queryset to filter only the ones you desire.

.. code:: python

    from ahem.scopes import QuerySetScope

    class TheNotification(Notification):
        ...
        scope = QuerySetScope(User.objects.filter(is_staff=True))
        ...

This will scope the notification only to staff users.

ContextFilterScope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``ContextFilterScope`` filters the ``User`` model according to a param
specified in the context passed to the notification when it's scheduled.

.. code:: python

    from ahem.scopes import ContextFilterScope
    class TheNotification(Notification):
        ...
        scope = ContextFilterScope(
            context_key='user_is_admin', lookup_field='is_admin')
        ...

    # This will send the notification only to non admin users
    TheNotification.schedule(context={'user_is_admin': False})

filter\_scope(self, queryset, context)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extra filters can be performed in the ``Notification`` ``scope`` by
adding a ``filter_scope`` method to your notification. This method
should return a list of ``User``\ s

.. code:: python

    # This will restrict the notification to users with `first_name` "Camila"
    class TheNotification(Notification):
        ...
        scope = QuerySetScope(User.objects.filter(is_staff=True))

        def filter_scope(self, queryset, context):
            return queryset.filter(first_name='Camila').all()

Triggers
--------

Triggers define when notifications will be send. Currently the two types
of triggers available are: ``DelayedTrigger`` and ``CalendarTrigger``,
but you can also write custom ones by extending ``NotificationTrigger``.

DelayedTrigger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``DelayedTrigger``\ s should receive a timedelta as their first param.
This will specify how long should be waited before sending the
notification. If a timedelta is not specified, the notification will be
imediately sent. You can optitionaly pass ``at_hour`` and/or
``at_minute`` kwargs. By doing this, after timedelta is added to the
current time, the hour and minute will be overwriten to the ones you
specified.

.. code:: python

    from datetime import timedelta
    from ahem.triggers import DelayedTrigger

    # Will send 2 days after scheduled at 18:00.
    class TheNotification(Notification):
        ...
        trigger = DelayedTrigger(timedelta(days=2), at_hour=18, at_minute=0)
        ...

CalendarTrigger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``CalendarTrigger`` are periodic notifications, use ``Celery``
``crontab`` to define it's periodicity. See ``Celery`` documentation for
more info:
http://celery.readthedocs.org/en/latest/userguide/periodic-tasks.html#crontab-schedules

.. code:: python

    from celery.schedules import crontab
    from ahem.triggers import CalendarTrigger

    # Will send notifications everyday at midnight
    class TheNotification(Notification):
        ...
        trigger = CalendarTrigger(crontab(hour=0, minute=0))
        ...

Templates
---------

``templates`` specify which template should be used to render
notification content. There should be at least a ``default`` template,
but you can specify a different one for each backend. When rendering the
template, all context variables will be available.

.. code:: python

    class TheNotification(Notification):
        ...
        templates = {
            'default': 'path/to/your/template.html',
            'email': 'path/to/email/template.html'}

Tests
-----

Use ``tox`` to run tests.
